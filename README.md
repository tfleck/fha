Website for Firestone High Adventure

Here's a website I created for Firestone High Adventure.
It's bones are based off of a bootstrap template I got here:

Yes, I'm aware High 5 isn't part of it yet, and the content is a little lacking.

If you guys think this looks good, then I will polish it up and fix the bugs
The mobile layout in particular needs some work
